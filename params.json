They are in the same format that Professor Troy\r\nsuggested that students use in the write-up, with some added constraints:\r\n\r\n- the board has to be a 6x6 puzzle\r\n- all of the pieces in the puzzle can be either:\r\n  - width  = 1, height = 2 or 3\r\n  - height = 1, width = 2 or 3\r\n- number of pieces:\r\n  - one goal piece\r\n  - up to 8 regular pieces\r\n- the order for piece input for each line of the game file:\r\n- row, column, width, height, movement\r\n\r\nPlease note the single spaces between each number, and please note that the program assumes perfect file input:\r\nthere is NO error checking for the format of the file.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWhen using the \"solve\" button using the supplied puzzles, finding the solutions can take up to fifteen seconds.\r\nIf you choose to add a puzzle, please be patient.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we will be providing a full write up and JavaDoc later on this week (today is Mon March 31, 2014).\r\n\r\nFinally, thanks for grading this project!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
